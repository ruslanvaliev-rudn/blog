## 🧩 Lightweight Markup Languages: Simplicity Meets Structure

Lightweight markup languages are formats designed to structure text using minimal, human-readable syntax. They were created as alternatives to bulky and complex languages like HTML and XML.

---

### ❓ Why Use Lightweight Markup Languages?

They allow you to:
- 📄 structure text (headings, lists, quotes, links, etc.);
- ✍️ write readable documents without additional editors;
- 📤 quickly export text to HTML, PDF, and other formats;
- 🤝 simplify collaboration on documentation, notes, and technical texts.

### 📚 Popular Examples

#### **Markdown**
The most well-known and widely used lightweight language. Simple and intuitive: `#` for headings, `*` for lists, `**bold text**`.

- Heavily used on GitHub, in blogs, wikis, and README files.
- Supported by most content management systems.

#### **reStructuredText (reST)**
More strict and powerful than Markdown. Common in the Python community (e.g., for documentation via Sphinx).

- Supports advanced structures: tables, cross-references, indexes.
- Requires attention to formatting.

#### **AsciiDoc**
A feature-rich language tailored for technical documentation.

- Offers more formatting capabilities than Markdown.
- Used in large projects like Red Hat documentation.

#### **Org-mode**
A language for Emacs that combines markup with task and agenda management.

- Suitable for notes, TODO lists, and exporting to LaTeX, PDF, HTML.
- Especially popular among Emacs users.
